* Date (ld): This column represents the date in the format of MM/DD/YYYY.

* Day of the Week (dow): It indicates the day of the week, where 1 likely corresponds to Sunday.

* Month (month): This column represents the month, with November in this specific example.

* Year (year): It specifies the year, which is 2015 in this case.

* Time (time): This column denotes the time, which is set at midnight (12:00:00 AM) in this particular record.

* Weekend (weekend): This is a binary column (TRUE/FALSE) indicating whether the day is a weekend (Sunday in this case).

* Weather Parameters: There are several weather-related columns, including Temperature at 2 meters above ground (T2M), Dew Point Temperature at 2 meters (T2MDEW), Wet Bulb Temperature at 2 meters (T2MWET), Specific Humidity at 2 meters (QV2M), Relative Humidity at 2 meters (RH2M), Precipitation Total Correction (PRECTOTCORR), Wind Speed at 10 meters above ground (WS10M), and Wind Speed at 2 meters (WS2M).

* Solar Parameters: The column labeled SP likely contains information related to solar conditions or solar radiation.

* Power Supplied (MW): This column appears to represent the power supplied in megawatts (MW) at the given date and time.


****Project Summary: Power Sector Analysis with Weather Data****

In this project, I dive into the dynamic world of the power sector, where I explored the intricate relationship between weather conditions and power supply. The dataset is a created by merging weather parameters with power supply data. 

Here's a snapshot of what our project entails:

* Data Fusion: We have harnessed data from multiple sources, bringing together weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, alongside essential time-related factors like date, time of day, and day of the week. This fusion of diverse data points allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment in which power generation and distribution occur.


* Weather-Driven Insights: By delving into the weather-related columns, we uncover the impact of climate factors on the power sector. We can assess how temperature, humidity, and wind speed affect power demand and supply, potentially revealing opportunities for more efficient energy management.


* Predictive Modeling: Armed with this rich dataset, I embark on predictive modeling journeys using Machine Learning Methodsd and Deep learning. By leveraging machine learning, I  was able to forecast power supply  based on historical weather patterns, ultimately contributing to more reliable and efficient energy planning.

In our exploratory data analysis, I delved into variable distributions, feature contributions to prediction, F-value feature importance, and estimated mutual importance value. These analyses provided critical insights into the interplay between weather and power supply.

The machine learning performance assessment revealed that deep learning outperforms most machine learning algorithms, while Random Forest exhibits strong performance similar to Support Vector Machine. Notably, Support Vector Machine demands more time and computational resources for comparable results.

The key takeaway from this project is the importance of selecting the right method for filling missing values and the significance of hyperparameter tuning in model optimization.
